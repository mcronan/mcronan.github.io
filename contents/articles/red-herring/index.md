Good comediens, like poets, have a way of making complex systems simple for us. It's how they make us laugh at serious issues.

I was reminded of this whilst listening to Bill Burr's Monday Morning Podcast. If you haven't heard it, I highly recommend you to do so - if you want to hear an almost-middle-aged man complain about his weight and how the fridge isn't stocked, look no further. Really. 

He was in the middle of telling an awkward story about a sauna, and lamented that the wealthy can avoid such instances by putting a sauna in their home. He continued:
 
## "when you have enough money, you can exit society"



He's right. From airplanes to restaurants, to sports games and concerts, to eduation, it is possible to live your life without becoming really involved in mainstream society.

I can't imagine having different segments of society breathing the same air but living in parallel words is good for us. 

But aren't those people following a rational choice, or at least an easier choice? You have to wonder - if given the means, wouldn't most people choose those 'opt out' activites?
