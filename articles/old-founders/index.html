            <p>Recently I noticed something that should have been obvious. All of the startups blogs I follow, and most of the twitter accounts I follow regularly, are are wrriten by middle-aged founders.</p>

<p>Despite all of the hullabulah around young founders and young 'innovators', they simply don't have many interesting things to say.</p>

<p>There is nothing like hearing war stories from experienced founders. The shit they went through, the happy times, and how they reacted to strugggles.</p>

<p>A lot can be learned from succintly-told stories, distilled from years on the field. And a lot of mistaked can be avoided.</p>

<p>Experience is interesting, as it turns out.</p>

<p>Given that the <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/628028017214750720">average age of a founder in Silicon Valley is 39 years old</a>, experience might be profitable, too.</p>
